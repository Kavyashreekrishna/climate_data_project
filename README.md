🌍 Climate & Data Science / AI Tutorial

Module 1: Data Science Fundamentals
📘 Overview

This repository is part of the Climate & Data Science / AI Tutorial Series, designed to teach data science fundamentals using real-world climate datasets.
In Module 1, you’ll learn to collect, analyze, and visualize meteorological data to uncover trends and patterns in temperature, rainfall, and other environmental parameters.

🧠 Module 1: Data Science Fundamentals

Duration: 4 Weeks
Goal: Build strong foundations in Python, statistics, and visualization — with a focus on climate data.

🔹 1. Data Science Lifecycle

Problem definition & hypothesis formulation

Data collection and preprocessing

Model building and validation

🔹 2. Basic Statistics & Math for Data Science

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance)

Probability distributions and sampling

Hypothesis testing & confidence intervals

Linear algebra (vectors, matrices)

Calculus for optimization

Bayesian thinking & conditional probability

🔹 3. Data Types & Structures (Climate Focus)

Structured: CSV, Databases, APIs

Semi-structured: JSON, XML (Weather feeds)

Unstructured: Satellite images, sensor logs

Time series: Temperature, rainfall, wind patterns

Geospatial: Coordinates, polygons, raster grids

Real-time: IoT sensors, weather stations

Climate formats: NetCDF, GRIB, HDF5

🔹 4. Statistical Analysis

Time series analysis basics

Correlation & regression

Trend analysis & seasonality

🔹 5. Python for Climate Data

Data analysis with NumPy and Pandas

Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Geospatial data processing

🧩 Hands-on Project

📊 Project: 10-Year Climate Trend Analysis
